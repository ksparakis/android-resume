## Description
I have made countless android apps, yet somehow have never uploaded one to the actual appstore. This is why I decided to make this app. I wanted to show that I have android development skills.

I also have never used google cloud before making of this project. I experimented with the server making the release via google cloud functions, app engine and compute engine. Ran into a lot of issues trying to use all three, but I enjoyed the console more then that of Amazon's. But struggled to get things to work, which was a pain. I found there to be a lot of issues with node, and the javascript api library doesn't want to compile for certain versions of node.

## Things to note if duplicating
Make sure to make all the images as small as possible aim for no more then 20kb per image. I had to use the picasso library to load the images, and still ran into uses where the size of the images would lag the app untill it crashed.
